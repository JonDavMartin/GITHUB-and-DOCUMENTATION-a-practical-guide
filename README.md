# Github and Documentation
A practical guide for showcasing how to use Github to document your open source project.

Along with the guide, a short introdution to the main elements required to accomplish the submentioned task are available (that is documentation, Github, Markdown, the Readme and the Wiki page). You'll also have the opportunity to find a concrete exemple of documentation in our Wiki page.

## About
Started in the SDG solution space in Geneva, we aim to provide potential makers with a guide as well as an example of how to use Github to document their projects and activities. New makers might indeed not be familiar with the notion of documentation, the tools available to that purpose and the way of using those tools efficiently. Well, this is exactly the reason this project has been designed for.

For those who have only few experience in documentation and who might feel anxious at the idea of using and struggling with Github: **no worries**. As a non-technical person, I already found myself in this situation, which consequently slowed down the progression of the project I needed to document at that time. 

By following this guide, you should be able to reduce substantially your *documentation learning time*, that is the hours you should spend to become aware of the importance of documentation (1), to look for an effective way to document your project (2) and to learn how to use a tool that allows you to do so (3).

This guide is divided in three parts: Introduction to Github/Markdown, Introduction to documentation (theory) and a practical guide.

# Introduction to documentation THEORY

## Why I should document my project
To answer this question, let me quote an inspiring webpage from [projectconnections.com](https://www.projectconnections.com/knowhow/burning-questions/what-is-project-documentation.html):
> When your business focuses on efficiency, cost minimization, and speed-to-market, creating lots of documentation can seem counterproductive. If the documentation doesn't directly support a deliverable, why do it? Project documentation covers documents created during and for the project itself. The documentation process has a deeper purpose than merely creating piles of paper.
> > Documentation ***stimulates and structures critical thinking*** in planning the project's goals, risks, and constraints. The document is the evidence and chronicle of this critical thinking.

> > It ***provides memory containers*** for managing a level of detail that cannot be kept in people's heads. This includes the small details easily overlooked during day-to-day project work, as well as the larger things easily remembered today, but potentially lost or forgotten due to the passage of time or critical personnel changes.

> > It ***keeps the team and other stakeholders synced up and informed about project changes, issues, and progress.***

> In many projects, the documentation is often done late, done poorly, or not done at allâ€”usually because the documentation is perceived as having little or no value. And, in fact, this is true if the documents are created as an afterthought or a necessary evil. Even documents with adequate content will lose value if they are created at the wrong time during the project, or aren't used in the project management process. Here are some examples:

> > ***Timing***: If the project documentation is created at the wrong project stage, it may have little or no value, even if its content is quite good. **Examples**: a vision document created late in the project; a detailed schedule created before the stakeholders have agreed on an overall project vision.

> > ***Use***: If the plan, vision, or risk analysis documents are created and then rarely or never referenced, they will likely have little or no value except for generating some initial critical thinking during their creation. **Examples**: a risk analysis that isn't referenced to measure progress on mitigations, or updated with newly discovered risks as they occur; a requirements document that isn't referenced later as a design completeness checklist.

> > ***Content***: Inadequate or incomplete content decreases a document's value, even if it is created on time and used correctly. **Examples**: a status report for product development that doesn't track the product costs; a risk analysis that doesn't include risk mitigations.

## Difficulty of documenting on Github
Technical difficulties and obstacles may well make up one of the reasons preventing makers from documenting their project on Github. This is especially the case for those who, like me, have almost no technical or coding background. Some attention, efforts and time are therefore needed by some people to get used to Github and its "readme-language" called *[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)*. 

But this is no sufficient reason to make you abandon documentation. Github, thanks to some of its features (in particular to its version control system), is in fact a really good tool for documentation since it automatically records all the changes people have done as well as the steps they have taken during their projects. Soon after starting your github documentation, you'll realize how useful and beneficial it can be for you and your team.

# Introduction to Github

Why is Github even interesting for someone who'd like to document its project? 
Github, through its version control system, is indeed a more than relevant tool for keeping track of one's project and letting people (within *and* outside of your team) know about *what is and has been going on*: it automatically records all the changes that have been done and stores the steps that have been taken throughout any project that it hosts.

## Start using Github

Github already provides us with a very helpful [github guide](https://guides.github.com) that helps people understand and use Github better. I would recommend to anyone willing to start using Github to consult this guide before starting. Yet, no need to understand and go through all the chapters at once. Just go for the chapters that are the most relevant for you:  

...[**Hello world**](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/): this chapter is a very clear introduction to the main features you'll be using for creating your documentation:
- What is Github?
- Creating an open source repository
- starting and managing a new branch
- Changing a file and commiting those changes on Github
- Opening and merging a pull request

...[**Github pages**](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/): this chapter guides you on how to create and manage a public webpage/site for your project that Github will then host for free (like the webpage that I created and that you are currently reading).

...[**Documenting your project on Github**](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/): this chapter is one of the most interesting for us; it clearly mentions the role of Github as a documentation tool and the tools Github provides you to achieve a good documentation, namely the README (a first and overall presentation of your project) and the WIKI page (the page where you'll be able to document your project and all your activities in detail).
    
## Start using Markdown

Documentation on Githbub is based on Markdown, also defined on Wikipedia as
> *a [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) with plain text formatting syntax [...] with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format"* 

Github precisely provides us with a guide on how to use Markdown to start wrinting your readme/wiki page.

... [**Mastering Markdown**](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/): this chapter shows you how to start using the Markdown language. It is a basic introduction. For more information and further learning, I'd recommend you to check out [this webpage](https://help.github.com/en/categories/writing-on-github).
