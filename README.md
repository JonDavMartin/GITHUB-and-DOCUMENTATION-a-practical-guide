## Introduction: 
* The physical output of this project will be in the form of a luminous ruler that indicates the duration of an activity or event to help people mannage their time better when they, for example, hold a speech. 
* Yet, the main purpose of this project is related to **documentation** and is mainly about learning to use Github as a documenting tool for maker projects. Github, through its version control system, is indeed a more than relevant tool for keeping track of one's project and letting people know about *what is and has been going on*. Our project also contains two elements that makers sometimes find difficult to document: code and design.

###### Day 1 (02/02/2019): Right after deciding to start this project Jean-Marie and I...
- [x] first drew the sketch of our hardware on a small sheet of paper
- [x] created this repository on Github to start documenting ASAP
- [ ] need to upload the picture of our the elements we'll be using for our project
