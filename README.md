# Github and Documentation
A practical guide for showcasing how Github can be used to document your open source project.
In this guide, we choosed to create a "time ruler" as the physical device we'll be documenting, thus giving a concrete exemple of how Github can be used to document your project.

## About
Time Ruler, started in the SDG solution space in Geneva, is a project aiming to provide potential makers with an example of how to use Github to document their own projects and activities. The documentation of Time Ruler is based on Markdown, also defined on Wikipedia as
> *a [lightweight markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) with plain text formatting syntax [...] with the goal of enabling people "to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format"* 

Its purpose is therefore to help people document their project by showing them how to store their projects' documentation on Github. Github, through its version control system, is indeed a more than relevant tool for keeping track of one's project and letting people (within *and* outside of your team) know about *what is and has been going on*: it automatically records all the changes that have been done and stores the steps that have been taken throughout any project that it hosts.

Now, the physical output of this project that we'll be documenting will be in the form of a luminous ruler that indicates the duration of an activity or event to help people manage their time better during this activity (such as a speech, a show etc). 

## Why I should document my project
To answer this question, let me quote an inspiring webpage from [projectconnections.com](https://www.projectconnections.com/knowhow/burning-questions/what-is-project-documentation.html):
> When your business focuses on efficiency, cost minimization, and speed-to-market, creating lots of documentation can seem counterproductive. If the documentation doesn't directly support a deliverable, why do it? Project documentation covers documents created during and for the project itself.The documentation process has a deeper purpose than merely creating piles of paper.
> > Documentation **stimulates and structures critical thinking** in planning the project's goals, risks, and constraints. The document is the evidence and chronicle of this critical thinking.

> > It **provides memory containers** for managing a level of detail that cannot be kept in people's heads. This includes the small details easily overlooked during day-to-day project work, as well as the larger things easily remembered today, but potentially lost or forgotten due to the passage of time or critical personnel changes.

> > It **keeps the team and other stakeholders synced up and informed about project changes, issues, and progress.**

> In many projects, the documentation is often done late, done poorly, or not done at allâ€”usually because the documentation is perceived as having little or no value. And, in fact, this is true if the documents are created as an afterthought or a necessary evil. Even documents with adequate content will lose value if they are created at the wrong time during the project, or aren't used in the project management process. Here are some examples:

> > **Timing**: If the project documentation is created at the wrong project stage, it may have little or no value, even if its content is quite good. Examples: a vision document created late in the project; a detailed schedule created before the stakeholders have agreed on an overall project vision.

> > **Use**: If the plan, vision, or risk analysis documents are created and then rarely or never referenced, they will likely have little or no value except for generating some initial critical thinking during their creation. Examples: a risk analysis that isn't referenced to measure progress on mitigations, or updated with newly discovered risks as they occur; a requirements document that isn't referenced later as a design completeness checklist.

> > **Content**: Inadequate or incomplete content decreases a document's value, even if it is created on time and used correctly. Examples: a status report for product development that doesn't track the product costs; a risk analysis that doesn't include risk mitigations.

## Difficulty of documenting on Github
Technical difficulties and obstacles may well make up one of the reasons preventing makers from documenting their project on Github. This is especially the case for those who, like me, have almost no technical or coding background. Some attention, efforts and time are therefore needed by some people to get used to Github and its "readme-language" called *[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)*. 

But this is no sufficient reason to make you abandon documentation. Github, thanks to some of its features (in particular to its version control system), is in fact a really good tool for documentation since it automatically records all the changes people have done as well as the steps they have taken during their projects. Soon after starting your github documentation, you'll realize how useful and beneficial it can be for you and your team.

**Right after deciding to start this project, Jean-Marie and I...**
- [x] first drew the sketch of our hardware on a small sheet of paper
- [x] created this repository on Github to start documenting ASAP
> *how to create a repository: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/*
- [ ] need to upload the picture of our the elements we'll be using for our project

#### Day 2
(03/02/2019)
**After creating the repository on Github**
- [x] watched tutorials  and articles about Github to get a better picture of what it is
> *Github video tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjQznt-8kE*
> *Article on Github: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub*
        
- [x] Created my first branch, within this repository, called "Try-1" and started writing the readme
- [x] Started editing the readme based on (*https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/*)
