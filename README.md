# Time-Ruler

![Image one](Clock.png)

## Introduction: 
The physical output of this project will be in the form of a luminous ruler that indicates the duration of an activity or event to help people mannage their time better when they, for example, hold a speech. 

Yet, the main purpose of this project is related to **documentation** and is mainly about learning to use Github as a documenting tool for maker projects. Github, through its version control system, is indeed a more than relevant tool for keeping track of one's project and letting people know about *what is and has been going on*. Our project also contains two elements that makers sometimes find difficult to document: code and design.

#### Day 2 (03/02/2019): after creating the repository on Github
- [x] watched tutorials  and articles about Github to get a better picture of what it is
